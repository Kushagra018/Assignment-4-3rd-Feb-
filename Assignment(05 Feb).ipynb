    "Ans) In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating instances, also known as objects. A class encapsulates data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on that data. It provides a way to create multiple objects with the same structure and behavior. Objects are the instance of the class  .Objects have their own unique identity and can have their own specific values for the attributes defined in the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "FOR EXAMPLE- lets consider \"car\" as a class. Now car class would define the properties and behaviours that are common in all the cars such as \"colour\", \"brand\",\"name\",\"model\" and so on. These are the properties and behaviours can be represented as attributes and methods within the class.\n"
